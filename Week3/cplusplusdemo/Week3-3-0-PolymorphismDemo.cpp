//object composition is the process of creating complex objects from simpler ones.
//the “has - a” relationship is called composition.
///Polymorphism allows a collection of objects of different types to be manipulated through a single common interface
//One way to draw this heterogeneous collection of shapes is to use a switch statement
//drawShapes() function needs to “know” about all of the kinds of shapes that can be drawn.
//difficult to add new types of shapes to the system
//The solution is to insulate the majority of our code from any knowledge of the types of objects with which it might be dealing.
//A virtual function—the C++ language’s primary polymorphism mechanism
